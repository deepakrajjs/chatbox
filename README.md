## 🚀 Features

- **Modern Chat UI**: Clean, mobile-friendly design with clear user/bot message distinction.
- **Async Messaging**: Uses `fetch` API for smooth, real-time communication.
- **Easy Integration**: Connects to any backend responding at `/api/chat`. 
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully reports API/network errors.  
- **Lightweight**: All logic and styling in a single HTML file.

## 🛠️ Getting Started 

### 1. Clone or Download
Save the `index.html` file from this repository.

### 2. Backend Requirements
You need a backend that accepts POST requests at `/api/chat` and returns AI-generated replies.

**Expected Request:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hello!" }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "reply": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
}
```

### 3. Run Locally

- **Option 1:** Serve with Python (static server):
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server
  ```
- **Option 2:** Use any web server or integrate with your backend.

### 4. Open in Browser
Visit `http://localhost:8000` (or your server’s URL).

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **Network errors:** Open browser dev tools for console logs.
- **API format mismatch:** Make sure backend returns `{ "reply": "..." }` in JSON.
