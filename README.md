## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started 

### 1. Clone or Download
Save the `index.html` file from this repository.

### 2. Backend Requirements
You need a backend that accepts POST requests at `/api/chat` and returns AI-generated replies.

**Expected Request:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hello!" }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "reply": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
}
```

### 3. Run Locally

- **Option 1:** Serve with Python (static server):
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server
  ```
- **Option 2:** Use any web server or integrate with your backend.

### 4. Open in Browser
Visit `http://localhost:8000` (or your server‚Äôs URL).

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting
